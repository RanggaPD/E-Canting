# E-Canting

E-Canting is an electronic canting that is an innovation of conventional canting, equipped with a temperature and viscosity controller connected to an Arduino Nano as a control device. On the upper part of the E-Canting body, there is a monitor and three buttons to display and adjust the temperature and viscosity of the required night candle.

E-Canting is designed with a handle to make it easier for batik craftsmen to apply night candles. It also uses a servo to control the opening and closing levers of the canting nib to flow the candle. The canting nib is made in a variety of sizes to make it easier for batik craftsmen to create batik motifs. The heater on the E-Canting is designed using a heater plate that produces heat up to 120 degrees Celsius.
